And this year, we take it even further. Directed by Noah Bremer and curated by Noah Bremer and Associate Directors Christopher Barton and Shannon Thorson, 2015&#39;s Haunted Basement returns to its roots with a series of twisted mazes and pathways leading to artist created environments built throughout the entire 13,000 square feet of The Soap Factory&#39;s basement. You will be separated from your group and fed into the depths a small handful at a time where you will be given a choice: follow the signs to take the &quot;less frightening&quot; path or be brave and take the path filled with more horror and more torment than ever before.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nOnce your path is chosen, there&#39;s no turning back. But beware; we may decide to switch the signs at any time.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAnd still, be bold with your choice. You never know when bravery will be rewarded.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThere is no set time. Maybe you&#39;ll find your way out. Maybe you&#39;ll be stuck in the nightmare until we decide to let you out. Be prepared. Our Basement Creeps are ready. And they&#39;ve been waiting for you.<br />\n<br />\nAlso new this year is an exhibition in Gallery 1 of The Soap Factory&#39;s first floor space; a disturbing maze where you will be forced to wait until its your turn to be fed into the Basement. Curated by Noah Bremer, this exhibition will also highlight the strange and terrible beauty that makes up the visual artistry of the Haunted Basement.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe exhibition will also be open during gallery hours Wednesdays - Fridays 1-7pm and Sundays 12-5pm beginning September 24th.<br />\n<br />\nThe 2015 Haunted Basement visual artists include: Chip Limeburner (Montreal), Kasia Wasko, Anna Johnson, Justin Sims, Ryan Sanderson, Walker Friend and William Erickson.</p>\n\n<p>Interested in volunteering for the Haunted Basement?

This arc of representational work has always been devoid of humans, except for the depictions of nature&rsquo;s memory of them. Rabbits personify rapid growth, resilience, adaptation, and creation. They are the primary inhabitants of an irradiated landscape, filled with mysterious flowers and organic forms. This story of this time and place unfolds exponentially as Brockman explore new studio methods, and intuitively follow his creative and spiritual journey. The paintings and papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; masks selected for this exhibition represent a re-visitation of his history in art, theater, and non-linear storytelling, while also demonstrating the possibilities of creating from refuse and found materials. These works indicate a panic about the state of the natural world, mirroring the human conditions of sickness and recovery &ndash; loss and rebirth. Everything Must Live is an entry in an expanding world in which nature has rebound through the waste of human beings, charging through shadows toward light.<br />\n<br />\nBenjamin Davis Brockman was born in 1980 in Emporia, Kansas. Brockman has since lived in numerous places across the U.S., he studied art and film and worked in theater and fine art printing. He moved to Minneapolis to in 2009 to pursue an MFA in printmaking from the University of Minnesota. Since graduation, he has exhibited prints internationally, as well as creating and performing puppet shows at Open Eye Figure Theater and In the Heart of the Beast in Minneapolis. Brockman creates in his basement studio in Seward and prints at Leg Up Studio in Northeast Minneapolis. He works as a Special Education Assistant with Autistic Children.</p>\n", "primary_image_resource": {"modified_date": "2015-10-05T14:35:22Z", "versions": {"SIZED": "", "CARD_LARGE": "", "FULL": "", "CARD_SMALL": {"url": "http://cdn.mplsart.com/file_container/RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fMjI0MDAwMQ/card_small.png", "width": 700, "height": 367}, "THUMB": {"url": "http://cdn.mplsart.com/file_container/RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fMjI0MDAwMQ/thumb.png", "width": 160, "height": 160}}, "resource_id": "RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fMjI0MDAwMQ", "caption": null, "created_date": "2015-10-05T14:35:22Z", "resource_url": "http://www.mplsart.com/api/files/RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fMjI0MDAwMQ", "resource_type": "FileContainer"}, "featured": false, "primary_image_resource_id": "RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fMjI0MDAwMQ", "resource_url": "http://www.mplsart.com/api/events/RXZlbnQeHzU2NjExMzM1Nzg5NjA4OTY", "slug": "everything-must-live", "resource_type": "Event"}, {"event_dates": [{"category": "reception", "end": "2015-10-11T05:00:00Z", "venue": {"website": "", "city": "St. Paul", "name": "Northern Warehouse Artists' Co-op", "resource_id": "VmVudWUebm9ydGhlcm4td2FyZWhvdXNlLWFydGlzdHMtY28tb3A", "primary_image_resource_id": null, "country": "USA", "address2": "", "summary": "", "primary_image_resource": null, "email": "", "hours": null, "phone": "", "state": "MN", "address": "308 Prince Street", "content": "", "resource_url": "http://www.mplsart.com/api/galleries/VmVudWUebm9ydGhlcm4td2FyZWhvdXNlLWFydGlzdHMtY28tb3A", "category": "studios", "geo": [{"lat": 44.9492634, "lon": -93.083585600000006}], "slug": "northern-warehouse-artists-co-op", "resource_type": "Venue"}, "label": "Art Crawl", "start": "2015-10-09T05:00:00Z", "type": "timed", "venue_slug": "northern-warehouse-artists-co-op"}], "name": "Fall 2015 St. Paul Art Crawl", "resource_id": "RXZlbnQeHzU2OTk4NjY5MzYyMTM1MDQ", "url": "http://www.stpaulartcrawl.org", "summary": "Annual fall arts crawl  taking place in Lowertown and throughout  St. Paul featuring hundreds of artists and thousands of visitors.", "content": "<p>The Autumn edition of this semi-annual art show and sale happens Friday, Saturday and Sunday, October 9, 10 &amp; 11.&nbsp;Over 300 artists at 28 locations are participating.

Opens October 10th At Rosalux Gallery", "content": "<p><em>Pinch</em>, features new work from artists Amelia Biewald and Terrence Payne.&nbsp;<em>Pinch</em>&nbsp;will explore how cultural and personal&nbsp; identities are romanticized, manipulated, and influenced through Amelia&rsquo;s antiquated reflections on assumed cultural roots and Terrence&rsquo;s discerning and vibrant drawings of individual actions.</p>\n\n<p>Amelia Biewald&rsquo;s intimate and haunting watercolor paintings are derived from photographs taken on her recent&nbsp;<em>Grand Tour</em>&nbsp;of Northern Italy.&nbsp; Harking back to a desire to find a connection with a legacy of classical antiquity once shared by many 18th century Europeans, Biewald examines the tradition of the search for an assumed cultural heritage in order to break free of cultural hegemony at home.&nbsp; The Wedgewood inspired impressions Biewald has created for Pinch revisit the obsessive nature of seizing on past legacies and relate to a modern desire to appropriate the exotic into the increasingly banal of a shrinking world.</p>\n\n<p>Terrence Payne&rsquo;s archetypical portraits illustrate behavior at the fringes of acceptability in everyday life that are bent on directing the actions and ideals of the communities they inhabit.&nbsp; Payne examines the subtle and overt ways in which individuals can try to influence those around them for self preservation or personal gain which reveal their own fears and needs in the process.&nbsp; Payne uses the wit, words, and iconography familiar in his work to challenge the viewer into redefining their own place in the world and to ponder how they might influence the perceptions of those around them.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Image Credit: &quot;If Smarts Were

Meier will present a hand-drawn animation that records the temporality and vastness of the land located at the Sage Creek Campground in South Dakota&rsquo;s Badlands National Park. Through the animation process, Meier captured the passage of time and the evolution of land as it relates to this place.</p>\n\n<p><em>This exhibition is made possible in part by the voters of Minnesota through a grant from the Arrowhead Regional Arts Council. Meier was a recipient of a 2013 McKnight Visual Artist Fellowship. &nbsp;Thanks to appropriations from The McKnight Foundation and the Minnesota State Legislature&rsquo;s general and arts and cultural heritage funds.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edgeworlds&mdash;Jamie Kinroy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Jamie Kinroy&nbsp;visited&nbsp;Japan before calling Minneapolis home. His multicultural experiences collide within the artificial landscapes that he has illustrated for &ldquo;Edgeworlds.&rdquo; While he is inspired by the history of illustration, Kinroy rejects linear narrative. Instead, he focuses on intricately designed locations or environments. Each print, drawing, and painting becomes a window onto a familiar but undefinable scene that has the potential for infinite narratives.</p>\n\n<p>The opening reception for &ldquo;Standing

The artists featured in this exhibition point to architecture, furnishings, and self-imagery as a means of representing and simulating the vestiges of internal sensibilities, memory, and feeling.<br />\n<br />\nMany artists here take empty and temporary spaces as their subjects: pregnant thresholds momentarily cool with the sense of delay or a pause in activity. A sense of discomfort, maybe even transformation, settles in these interstitial chambers. Other artists point to objects as vehicles for self or avail their own image as a metric for tenor. In such containers, the lone self is fully on view: inadequate, restless, waiting.&nbsp;<em>No Vacancy</em>&nbsp;brings together artists from various career stages and mediums around the notion of letting in, or out, the metaphorical white noise from that shared sense of solitude.</p>\n\n<p>Curated by Jehra Patrick, the exhibition marks the one-year anniversary of Waiting Room&rsquo;s exhibition program.

M. Culver.", "content": "<p>Recreating the past through generational storytelling, figurative artist J. M. Culver&rsquo;s latest body of work examines the discrepancies between what is real and what is embellishment in human narrative. Through sensory triggers, quiet moments and thoughtful themework, Culver explores the concept of secondary memories. These large scale paintings bring the viewer through lucid and surreal scenes inspired by her grandfather&rsquo;s storytelling and struggle with schizophrenia. Culver&rsquo;s work presents a unique perspective on visually exploring character development, the strength of character behind mental illness, and the character as a metaphor.<br />\n<br />\nAs part of her&nbsp;<em>Artist Initiative Grant</em>&nbsp;project with seven months in the making, this collection creates a dialogue, each piece organically influencing the next yet each occupying a life of its own. Through her use of the large scale format, Culver sets out to create emotive imagery, which both draws the viewer in to become part of the scene and takes on a voyeuristic element. Shying away from nostalgia-based sentiments, Culver&rsquo;s work retracts memories while existing within a broad spectrum. Bordering between light and dark, her paintings embrace personal intimacy while providing open interpretations that unite the community through relatable life experiences.<br />\n<br />\nFor this exhibition, Culver showcases large scale figurative paintings created by both experimental and traditional mark-making using vivid colors not typical of her past repertoire. A behind-the-scenes video presentation will give an intimate view into the creative process and the challenges that arise while working within her specific medium. A selection of small originals and limited edition prints will also be on display and available for purchase during the exhibit&rsquo;s run.</p>\n\n<div><br />\n<br />\n<strong>ABOUT THE ARTIST</strong><br />\nJ. M. Culver is a contemporary figurative artist that creates psychological narratives with universal themes. She explores figuration and abstraction through a combination of painting and drawing. Prominent themes in her work are the transitory nature of memory, social dynamics and personal allegories that give an intimate and tangible glimpse into the human psyche.<br />\n<br />\nCulver attended Syracuse University in NY for graduate studies and holds a BFA in painting from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. She is a former gallery director and curator. She actively exhibits her work, which is held in private collections internationally. Culver lives and works in Minneapolis, MN.<br />\n<br />\nWebsite:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jmculver.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jmculver.com</a><br />\n<br />\nJ. M.

Moreover, his frequent inclusion of the Roman labyrinth motif &ndash; an ancient geometric pattern that embellished mosaic floors centuries ago &ndash; heightens this enigmatic link to the past.

Heikes proposed using this&nbsp;non-archival, decidedly untidy, and slightly noxious&nbsp;material in an unorthodox&nbsp;way - as ink -resulting in prints of extraordinary inventiveness and visceral&nbsp;power.&quot;</em><br />\n<br />\n-- Betsy&nbsp;Carpenter, Independent Curator</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;\"><strong><em>Niet Voor Kinderen: New Prints by Jay Heikes</em></strong>&nbsp;will&nbsp;be presented in Highpoint&rsquo;s main galleries, and will be on view October&nbsp;30&ndash;November 21, 2015, with an opening reception on October 30.

M. Culver.", "content": "<p>Recreating the past through generational storytelling, figurative artist J. M. Culver&rsquo;s latest body of work examines the discrepancies between what is real and what is embellishment in human narrative. Through sensory triggers, quiet moments and thoughtful themework, Culver explores the concept of secondary memories. These large scale paintings bring the viewer through lucid and surreal scenes inspired by her grandfather&rsquo;s storytelling and struggle with schizophrenia. Culver&rsquo;s work presents a unique perspective on visually exploring character development, the strength of character behind mental illness, and the character as a metaphor.<br />\n<br />\nAs part of her&nbsp;<em>Artist Initiative Grant</em>&nbsp;project with seven months in the making, this collection creates a dialogue, each piece organically influencing the next yet each occupying a life of its own. Through her use of the large scale format, Culver sets out to create emotive imagery, which both draws the viewer in to become part of the scene and takes on a voyeuristic element. Shying away from nostalgia-based sentiments, Culver&rsquo;s work retracts memories while existing within a broad spectrum. Bordering between light and dark, her paintings embrace personal intimacy while providing open interpretations that unite the community through relatable life experiences.<br />\n<br />\nFor this exhibition, Culver showcases large scale figurative paintings created by both experimental and traditional mark-making using vivid colors not typical of her past repertoire. A behind-the-scenes video presentation will give an intimate view into the creative process and the challenges that arise while working within her specific medium. A selection of small originals and limited edition prints will also be on display and available for purchase during the exhibit&rsquo;s run.</p>\n\n<div><br />\n<br />\n<strong>ABOUT THE ARTIST</strong><br />\nJ. M. Culver is a contemporary figurative artist that creates psychological narratives with universal themes. She explores figuration and abstraction through a combination of painting and drawing.

She is a former gallery director and curator. She actively exhibits her work, which is held in private collections internationally.

The show, A-Traction, inspired by modern ideals and Miller&rsquo;s appreciation of tradition, opens on December 4, 2015, and runs through January 2, 2016. A free opening reception will be held Friday, December 4, 7-10 p.m.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My aesthetic comes from a philosophy of a needs society rather than a wants society,&rdquo; Miller says. &ldquo;In other words, objects around us should serve a need. That harkens back to our Midwestern roots. Architectural structures like barns and silos had a purpose. Equipment like a tractor serves a need. Designers who created these things are some of my favorite &lsquo;artists.&rsquo; So I&rsquo;ve taken these hearty design aesthetics and applied them to my work.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dedicated to moving forward while adhering to the region&rsquo;s European immigrant past, Miller begins with traditional forms; he then re-imagines those forms with line, texture and color. As a result, his functional objects often bear sculptural qualities. For instance, Miller explains, &ldquo;I may start with the form of a silo, but then take it into a curve and inject some design spontaneity, until the shape become unrecognizable.&rdquo; Many of his works also reflect his love of the rural, Midwestern landscape.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to exhibit Ernest&rsquo;s new works in forms that reflect his love of the rural Midwest,&rdquo; says Patrick K. Pryor, curator and co-owner of Kolman &amp; Pryor Gallery. &ldquo;And yet, I feel his forms, while enticing, are secondary to the surface quality of his glazes. His virtuosity and tireless pursuit of near-perfection on the surface of his works are what makes him stand out among his contemporaries.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Miller formerly worked in a studio located in the Northrup King Building, where the Kolman &amp; Pryor Gallery is located, before moving to his current studio in North Minneapolis. &ldquo;Ernest&rsquo;s work is peerless in technique, ingenuity and aesthetic, so we were sad to see him leave the building,&rdquo; says Anita Sue Kolman, co-owner of Kolman &amp; Pryor Gallery. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re thrilled to be representing Ernest, one of our former neighbors, in our gallery and continuing the artistic relationship in a new way.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nMiller earned his BA from Eastern Illinois University in 1998. He worked as a potter in Champaign, Illinois before moving to Minneapolis in 2000 to establish a studio and a busy exhibition and teaching schedule. His work has been exhibited in various regional and national art fairs including the Uptown Art Fair in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Plaza Art Fair in Kansas City, Missouri. He teaches at Fired Up Studios in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the Minnetonka Center for the Arts in Wayzata, Minnesota. In 2011 he was the recipient of a Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative Grant.</div>\n", "primary_image_resource": {"modified_date": "2015-10-06T02:52:43Z", "versions": {"SIZED": "", "CARD_LARGE": "", "FULL": "", "CARD_SMALL": {"url": "http://cdn.mplsart.com/file_container/RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fODI4MDAwMQ/card_small.png", "width": 700, "height": 367}, "THUMB": {"url": "http://cdn.mplsart.com/file_container/RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fODI4MDAwMQ/thumb.png", "width": 160, "height": 160}}, "resource_id": "RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fODI4MDAwMQ", "caption": null, "created_date": "2015-10-06T02:52:43Z", "resource_url": "http://www.mplsart.com/api/files/RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fODI4MDAwMQ", "resource_type": "FileContainer"}, "featured": false, "primary_image_resource_id": "RmlsZUNvbnRhaW5lch4fODI4MDAwMQ", "resource_url": "http://www.mplsart.com/api/events/RXZlbnQeHzU3NjEyNTM4MzAwMzM0MDg", "slug": "a-traction-new-ceramics-by-ernest-miller", "resource_type": "Event"}, {"event_dates": [{"category": "reception", "end": "2015-12-05T04:00:00Z", "venue": {"website": "http://lightgreyartlab.com/", "city": "Minneapolis", "name": "Light Grey Art Lab", "resource_id": "VmVudWUebGlnaHQtZ3JleS1hcnQtbGFi", "primary_image_resource_id": null, "country": "USA", "address2": "#101", "summary": null, "primary_image_resource": null, "email": "", "hours": null, "phone": "612.239.2047", "state": "MN", "address": "118 East 26th St", "content": null, "resource_url": "http://www.mplsart.com/api/galleries/VmVudWUebGlnaHQtZ3JleS1hcnQtbGFi", "category": "gallery", "geo": [{"lat": 44.955741500000002, "lon": -93.275520200000003}], "slug": "light-grey-art-lab", "resource_type": "Venue"}, "label": "Opening", "start": "2015-12-05T01:00:00Z", "type": "timed", "venue_slug": "light-grey-art-lab"}], "name": "Bower Bird", "resource_id": "RXZlbnQeHzU3MTMxNDQwMjIzMDI3MjA", "url": "http://lightgreyartlab.com/blog/2015/9/7/bower-bird-call-for-artists", "summary": "An exhibition about curating & collecting", "content": "", "primary_image_resource": null, "featured": false, "primary_image_resource_id": null, "resource_url": "http://www.mplsart.com/api/events/RXZlbnQeHzU3MTMxNDQwMjIzMDI3MjA", "slug": "bower-bird", "resource_type": "Event"}, {"event_dates": [{"category": "sale", "end": "2015-12-12T22:30:00Z", "venue": {"website": "", "city": "Minneapolis", "name": "Colin Powell Center", "resource_id": "VmVudWUeY29saW4tcG93ZWxsLWNlbnRlcg", "primary_image_resource_id": null, "country": "USA", "address2": "", "summary": "", "primary_image_resource": null, "email": "", "hours": null, "phone": "", "state": "MN", "address": "2924 4th Ave S", "content": "", "resource_url": "http://www.mplsart.com/api/galleries/VmVudWUeY29saW4tcG93ZWxsLWNlbnRlcg", "category": "business", "geo": [{"lat": 44.949268600000003, "lon": -93.27110909999999}], "slug": "colin-powell-center", "resource_type": "Venue"}, "label": "Festival", "start": "2015-12-12T15:30:00Z", "type": "timed", "venue_slug": "colin-powell-center"}], "name": "23rd Annual Minnesota Women\u2019s Art Festival", "resource_id": "RXZlbnQeHzU2NzE2MTc1OTQxMzA0MzI", "url": "http://womensartfestival.com/index.php", "summary": "Annual Arts Festival supporting female artists", "content": "<p>The mission of the Women&rsquo;s Art Festival is to provide a welcoming place for women artists to show and sell their creations and to provide a fun and festive atmosphere for guest to shop, gather and enjoy community.&nbsp; Supporting local women artists of all experience levels, from first time exhibitors to experienced professionals, we are a non-juried show with the expectation that all goods are of excellent quality, made and sold by local women.
