                MPLSART.COMâ€™s mission is to promote visual art events in the Twin Cities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site is maintained purely in support of local art. It makes events accessible to a broad audience by providing a single source for a variety of listings and related information.

                Success is more people in attendance at art events, stronger sales of local art, and an open creative community that welcomes all art enthusiasts.

        <h2><b>History</b></h2>
        <p>
            MPLSART.COM was founded in 2005 by the incomparable designer/curator, Emma Berg. She saw a need for a consolidated, curated listing of important art events in the Twin Cities. In 2006, Emma was joined by fellow arts advocate, Kristoffer Knutson. Together, they ran the site and curated a host of exhibits and creativity-infused events. It was a work of passion, blood, sweat and so on.
